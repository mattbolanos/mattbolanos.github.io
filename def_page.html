      <div class="article-text">
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
        July 9, 2021 at 1:42 PM PT
      </p>
      <p>
        The first two games of this Finals have seen Milwaukee trying many different methods of defending Phoenix’s pick and roll sets, both personnel-wise and scheme-wise. Below are the different defenders that the Bucks used against the Sun’s two primary playmakers, Chris Paul and Devin Booker.
      </p>
      <img src="./assets/img/defender_chart.png" width="90%" height="90%">
      <p>
        I did not realize <span><a style="color: #555555;" class="project-title" href="https://theathletic.com/2695157/2021/07/08/how-did-suns-scheme-beat-milwaukee-in-game-1-and-can-bucks-switch-and-better-match-up-with-chris-paul/" target="_blank">Seth Partnow</a></span> had written an article and already made a defender distribution chart from G1 until l had already made my own chart so I’ll post it here anyway. I want to focus on how Milwaukee went about defending Chris Paul in the pick and roll. Game 1 featured a lot of switching from the Bucks. PJ Tucker got the first crack at Paul to limit the advantage Deandre Ayton would have over whoever switched off of Paul. This resulted in Chris pulling it back out often and taking Brook Lopez, Ayton’s man, out into space.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">
        A small note: a lot of crucial aspects of the Bucks' defensive decision making are cut out of the clips accessible via the NBA's video API, so I gathered the full play clips instead.
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Game 1</p>
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/573226322?h=9dbba9f606" controls muted playsinline

      <p>
        Phoenix’s spacing made it difficult for other defenders to help Lopez out on these isolations, leaving Brook stranded on Paul Island. Even though Lopez’s size allowed him to get average contests on some of these shots, CP can drain midranges with minimal room in his sleep. And when the Bucks did bring help, it lead to open catch and shoot 3s for the other Suns, creating a tough decision for Milwaukee to make under this scheme.
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/573226247?h=4d775892d5" controls muted playsinline 
       height="564" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        Milwaukee adjusted and started putting Lopez in a drop with Tucker fighting over the top. Unfortunately for the Bucks, drop coverage is where Paul and his snake dribble movement thrives. Here CP essentially runs away from the pursuing Tucker towards the sideline to get to his spot on the right side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Budenholzer pulled Lopez after these repeat sequences in favor of Bobby Portis, a more viable perimeter defender, at the 5 and went back to switching, in hopes of slowing down Paul with a slightly more agile big man. It did not go as planned.
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/573226380?h=c0048b3cbe" controls muted playsinline 
       height="564" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        With neither Portis or Lopez being able to stay on the floor defensively, Budenholzer eventually downsized and put Giannis Antetokounmpo at the center spot. Paul countered by hunting out the next weak link in Pat Connaughton, and the Suns pulled out Game 1 behind Paul’s 32 points on 12-19 shooting from the field. Going into the second game, adjusting ball screen coverage against Paul was crucial if Milwaukee were to keep up with Phoenix.
      </p>

      <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;margin-top: -.5%;">Game 2</p>
      <p>
        In Game 2, the Bucks flipped back to fighting over the top of ball screens and keeping Lopez in a drop. However, Jrue Holiday was now the primary defender, guarding Paul for about 20% more of the time than he did in G1. Holiday fared well early, forcing a pair of turnovers and then funneling Paul into a crowd where Antetokounmpo could get a rearview block.
